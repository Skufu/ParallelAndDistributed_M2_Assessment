#Spy vs Spy


This project implements a multithreaded simulation called "Spy vs. Spy," where two spies compete for resources in a shared environment. The program uses threads to simulate the actions of each spy (e.g., collecting resources, sabotaging each other) and shared memory to store resource pools, inventories, and logs. Synchronization mechanisms like mutexes ensure safe access to shared data.
